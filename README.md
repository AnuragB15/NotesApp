The Notes App is a simple, web-based tool for creating, editing, and deleting notes. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it offers a clean interface where users can quickly jot down thoughts and save them automatically using local storage. This ensures that notes persist even after refreshing the browser.

It is featuring a header with the app’s title and a “Create Notes” button that adds a new editable note to the interface. Each note can be modified directly and includes a delete icon for easy removal. The CSS provides a visually appealing layout with a gradient background, making the app both functional and attractive.

JavaScript handles the app’s functionality, allowing users to add, edit, and delete notes dynamically. The app updates local storage with every change, ensuring that notes are always saved and available upon returning to the page.
